# divide and conquer algorithm also like mergesort
# divides array into smaller parts and sorting them separately
'''
It works like this:
1. Select pivot from the array.
2. Divide the array into 3 parts:
    -smaller values than pivot
    -bigger values than pivot
    -pivot itself
3. Repeat the same process for the smaller and larger parts separately until the list is sorted.
