## ‚ú® What's Inside?

This repository contains my journey through the fascinating world of data structures and algorithms. Instead of just code, I focus on **visualizations** and **animations** to make these concepts come alive!

## üé¨ Animated Examples

Each implementation includes:

- Interactive visualizations
- Step-by-step animations
- Visual complexity analysis

## üß© Data Structures

| Structure    | Real-world Use            | Visualization                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arrays       | Spotify playlists         | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Array Animation](https://visualgo.net/en/list)     |
| Linked Lists | Web browsing history      | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è List Animation](https://visualgo.net/en/list)      |
| Trees        | File systems              | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tree Animation](https://visualgo.net/en/bst)       |
| Graphs       | Social networks           | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Graph Animation](https://visualgo.net/en/graphds)  |
| Hash Tables  | Instagram username lookup | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Hash Animation](https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable) |

| Dijkstra's    | Uber calculating fastest path   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch](https://visualgo.net/en/sssp)         |

## üíº Why This Matters in the Real World

### üåê Tech Companies Love DSA Experts

```
"We don't hire based on GPA. We look for problem-solving skills." - Google Recruiter
```

Modern tech companies rely on efficient algorithms for:

- **Streaming Services**: Netflix uses recommendation algorithms to suggest your next favorite show
- **Social Media**: Instagram's feed uses sorting algorithms to show you relevant content
- **E-commerce**: Amazon's product search uses advanced data structures
- **Maps**: Routing algorithms help you avoid traffic and find the fastest path

### üöó Real Impact

- A **10% faster** algorithm at Google saves millions in server costs
- A **more efficient** data structure at Spotify means less buffering for your music
- A **smarter search** algorithm at Amazon helps you find products instantly

## üéÆ Interactive Learning

Try these tools to see algorithms in action:

- [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/)
- [Sorting Algorithms Visualized](https://www.sortvisualizer.com/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this visualization-focused repo
git clone https://github.com/rikulauttia/data-structures-algorithms.git

```

## üí° Fun Facts

- The algorithm powering Google Search reads over 30 trillion web pages
- Instagram's explore page uses machine learning algorithms to find content you'll like
- Dating apps use matching algorithms similar to those we study in graph theory
- Video compression algorithms make streaming possible

## üîÆ What You'll Gain

- **Problem-solving superpowers** that apply across programming
- **Interview preparation** for top tech companies
- **Performance optimization** skills for any application you build
- **Visual thinking** abilities that help in system design
